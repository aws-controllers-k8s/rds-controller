  **About Amazon RDS**


  Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it easy to set up,
  operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides
  cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming
  administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching
  and backups. It frees you to focus on your applications so you can give them
  the fast performance, high availability, security and compatibility they need.


  Amazon RDS is available on several database instance types - optimized for
  memory, performance or I/O -and provides you with six familiar database
  engines to choose from, including Amazon Aurora, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB,
  Oracle Database, and SQL Server. You can use the AWS Database Migration
  Service to easily migrate or replicate your existing databases to Amazon RDS.
